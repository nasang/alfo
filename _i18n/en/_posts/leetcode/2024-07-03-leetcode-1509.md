### 1509. Minimum Difference Between Largest and Smallest Value in Three Moves <font color="orange">(Medium)</font>

#### Intuition

Suppose we have `N` numbers. If we remove `3` of them, we're left with `X = N - 3` numbers. We can sort the array and then check the distance between the smallest and largest numbers within each window of `X` numbers. The smallest of these distances is our answer.

#### Initial Solution

```py
# Time: O(NlogN)
# Space: O(1)
class Solution:
    def minDifference(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nums.sort()
        res = float(inf)
        n = len(nums)
        x = n - 3
        if x <= 0:
            return 0
        for i in range(n - x + 1):
            res = min(res, nums[i + x - 1] - nums[i])
        return res
```

#### More straigt forward

The removed 3 numbers could be the combination of follows:

- The 3 largest
- The 2 largest + the 1 smallest
- The 1 largest + the 2 smallest
- The 3 smallest

The solution above can be written as

```py
# Time: O(NlogN)
# Space: O(1)
class Solution:
    def minDifference(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nums.sort()
        if len(nums) <= 4:
            return 0
        res = float(inf)
        for a, b in zip(nums[:4], nums[-4:]):
            res = min(res, b - a)
        return res
```

#### Optimized

Furthermore, we can find that what really matters is the 4 largest numbers and the 4 smallest numbers. Suppose we have sorted arrays `max_4` and `min_4`, which store these numbers separately. The four situations described above are equivalent to:

- dis = `max_4[0]` - `min_4[0]`
- dis = `max_4[1]` - `min_4[1]`
- dis = `max_4[2]` - `min_4[2]`
- dis = `max_4[3]` - `min_4[3]`

In other words, we don't have to sort the entire array; we only need to maintain the top 4 largest numbers and the top 4 smallest numbers.

```py
# Time: O(N)
# Space: O(1)
class Solution:
    def minDifference(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if len(nums) <= 4:
            return 0
        min_4 = nsmallest(4, nums)
        max_4 = nlargest(4, nums)
        return min([max_4[i] - min_4[3 - i] for i in range(4)])
```
