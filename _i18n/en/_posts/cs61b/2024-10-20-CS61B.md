# 1. Intro
## 1.1 Java
```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello world!");
    }
}
```
Java is an **object oriented language** with strict requirements:
- Every Java file must contain a **class** declaration*.
- **All code** lives inside a class*, even helper functions, global constants, etc.
- To run a Java program, you typically define a **main method** using `public static void main(String[] args)`

*: This is not completely true, e.g. we can also declare "interfaces" in .java files that may contain code.

Java is **statically typed**
- All variables, parameters, and methods must have a **declared type**.
- That type can **never change**.
- Expressions also have a type, e.g. "larger(5, 10) + 3" has type int.
- The compiler checks that all the types in your program are compatible **before** the program ever runs.

## 1.2 Java workflow
![compilation](1/compilation.png){: w="500" h="300" }

```sh
$ javac HelloWorld.java
$ java HelloWorld
Hello World! 
```

Why make a class file at all?
- class file has been type checked. Distributed code is **safer**.
- class files are 'simpler' for machine to execute. Distributed code is **faster**.


# 2. Classes, Lists, Arrays, Maps
## 2.1 Classes
- Classes can contain not just functions (a.k.a. **methods**), but also data (a.k.a. **variables**).
- Classes can be instantiated as **objects**.

Static vs. Non-Static Members
- A variable or method defined in a class is also called a **member** of that class. 
- A class may have a mix of **static** and **non-static** members.
  - Static members are accessed using class name.
  - Non-static members cannot be invoked using class name.
  - Static methods must access instance variables via a specific instance.
    
## 2.2 Lists
> A **list** is an ordered sequence of objects.

```java
import java.util.List;
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class ListDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> L = new ArrayList<>();
        L.add("a"); 
        L.add("b"); 
        String x = L.get(0);
    }
}
```

- **List** in Java is **Abstract Data Type (ADT)**
- Each implementation, e.g. **LinkedList**, is known as a **Concrete Implementation**.
  - Code for different types of list may be radically different.
  - All concrete implementations have at least [the operations guaranteed by every List](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/List.html).

## 2.3 Arrays
> A **array** is a restricted version of the list ADT.
- Size that must be declared at the time the array is created.
- Size cannot change.
- No methods.

```java
public class ArrayDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String[] x = new String[5]; // size 5
        x[0] = "a";
        x[1] = "b";
        System.out.println(x[0]);
    }
}
```

## 2.4 Maps
> A **map** is collection of key-value pairs. Each key is guaranteed to be unique.

```java
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.TreeMap;
 
public class MapDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Map<String, String> L = new TreeMap<>();
        L.put("dog", "woof");
        L.put("cat", "meow");
        String sound = L.get("cat");
  }
}
```

The most common Map implementations are **TreeMap** and **HashMap**. 
- Python uses an ArrayList (without telling you).
- Python uses a HashMap (without telling you).
